The folder structure in a Flutter project consists of specialized subfolders, each focusing on specific tasks and residing under the lib folder. This structure is used to organize project files and make the development process more orderly.

- bindings: This folder contains the logic for bindings in GetX, particularly the bindings for pages managed with GetX.

- controllers: It's the folder where controllers for pages managed with GetX reside. There might be a controller for each page.

- globals: This folder houses resource files intended for general use. For example, images (assets), colors, and text styles used throughout the application are found under this folder.

- models: It's the folder where model classes used for processing data fetched from services reside. These models represent the data structure within the application.

- routes: This folder handles page navigation. Page structures managed with the Get package are defined under this folder.

- screens: It's the folder where all screen code resides. Each screen represents a part of the user interface.

- services: This folder contains service classes used to communicate with external services (API requests, database operations, etc.).

- widgets: It's the folder where customized components used throughout the application are found. These components include reusable UI elements commonly used within the application.

This folder structure ensures that the code is organized and makes maintenance easier, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of the development process.
